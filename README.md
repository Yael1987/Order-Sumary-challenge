## My process

  I try to use just CSS and HTML but for the positioning I used Flexbox, also I used responsive units like rem to make the mobile version

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Responsive units

### Continued development

  I'll continue devaloping and trying to be faster by coding cause this took me a little of time to do it. Note: Forgive my bad English, I haven't practiced much:(
